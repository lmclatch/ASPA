Project Objective
-----------------

Goal: Process and Transfer Water use data to USGS 

Specifics:
To utilize American Samoa Power Authority water usage data of customers and 
group it by village, usage, and month to be readable in a WaDE Schema format therefore 
USGS can ingest our data and utilize it in their water use data initiative. 
This included well data that was deemed to be production and the customer usage data was deemed 
consumptive use to distinguish the difference between them. 
The data needed to be made easily accessible so a third party cloud server was utilized to 
implement the data cleaning procedure and post the final readable data to an easily accessible data site.
