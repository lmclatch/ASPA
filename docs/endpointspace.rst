Object Space Endpoint
========================================

Note: This page specifically explains Digital Ocean's object endpoint space utilized to share this project's finalized data.


Introduction
------------

Object Endpoint Spaces are a crucial aspect of the ASPA WUDR project, allowing for efficient management and routing of data.

Definition
-----------------


Requirements
-----------------
To send data to the created space in Digital Ocean, these are required

Space Name: Just the name of your object space 

Space Region: The region your space is in

Space Secret Key: The secret API key given to you

Space Acess Key: The acess key given to you from the same API above

To access data, the output .CSVs can be made public

Specific Use
-----------------
The benefits of the object endpoint space is that the data can be accessed relatively easy. Each created .CSV has its own URL, that when entered into a web browser, downloads the most recent output from the function. These .CSVs have descriptive labels and include all data formatted to WaDE 2.0 specifics.
